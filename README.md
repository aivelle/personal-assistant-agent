# Personal Assistant Agent

This is a lightweight, intention-based AI assistant system designed to manage and support personal productivity workflows using Notion, Google services (Calendar, Meet, Gmail), and other integrated tools. The assistant runs on Cloudflare Workers and connects with a Custom GPT to receive and process user input, perform task coordination, and manage calendar updates and project flows efficiently.

## 🔧 Features

- Context-aware scheduling and task suggestions based on user's Notion and Google Calendar data
- Dynamic intent classification to determine next actions
- Supports email-based requests, reminders, summaries, and more
- Modular workflow files with simplified routing logic
- Easy to customize and extend with JSON-based configuration
